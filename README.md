As an administrator, I've found creating shortcuts to frequently used items very useful.  This powershell can be used to put a bunch of shortcuts in c:\Admin\Shortcuts folder.
And some shortcuts on the desktop.  I'm very fond of _Logoff and Public Desktop shortcuts.  Cmd_As_Admin and Powershell_ISE_As_Admin are good to have as well.

What shortcuts do you think may need to be added?
